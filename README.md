Polymath Scholar + Statistics & Data Science @ UT Austin

I am a Statistics & Data Science major at The University of Texas at Austin with a passion for turning complex datasets into actionable business strategies. My background focuses on technical precision and building scalable data solutions.

Currently, I leverage tools like Python, SQL, and Machine Learning to solve real-world problems—from building demand forecasting models in BigQuery ML to deploying automated ETL pipelines. Whether I’m engineering AI automation agents or advising on AI strategy, I focus on the intersection of technical execution and business value.

Technical Toolkit:

Programming: Python, Java, SQL, and Pandas.

Data Science: Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and BigQuery ML.

Tools: BigQuery, n8n, Cursor, and Tkinter.

I am eager to apply my skills to projects where data-driven insights lead to impactful decision-making. Let’s connect if you’re working at the cutting edge of Business Analytics or AI implementation.
